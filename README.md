# NTLib

NTLib project aims to help you build C\C++ system application depended on NTDLL.dll API. As result you can link your application with NTDLL over regular Windows SDK or WDK (or without any) and use private and public definitions.

The project is in active developing state so only part of a project is ready to use.

Our goals are:
- Make LIB files and headers for NTDLL stuff (based on https://github.com/processhacker/phnt project)
- Make a helper library, to simplify a development
- Make a CRT for NTDLL-only or native apps compilation
