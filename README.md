# NTLib

NTLib project aimed to help you build C\C++ system application depended to NTDLL.dll API. As result you can link your application with NTDLL over regular Windows SDK or WDK and use a private and public definitions.

The project is in active developing state so only part of a project is ready to use.

Our goals are:
+ Make LIB files and headers for NTDLL stuff (based on https://github.com/processhacker/phnt project)
- Make a helper library, to simplify a development
- Make a CRT for NTDLL-only or native apps compilation
